                <p>
                  A blockchain is a continously growing (linked) list of
                  records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using
                  cryptography. A block will have the data, previous hash
                  (pointing to previous block) and current hash. The first block
                  in the blockchain is called the genesis block. It will not
                  have the previous hash populated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The hash of the block is cryptographic output of the data in
                  the block. The next block in the block chain will point to
                  this crryptographic hash. So, if the data in the previous
                  block changed, then the next block will no longer point to it
                  and the chain will be broken. This ensures the immutability of
                  data in the block chain.

                  The change in hash causes the block chain to break and that is
                  why we are saying that the blocks are cryptographically linked
                  together. A good simulation of block chain is available

                <p>
                  The idea behind hashing is that, any data, no matter what the
                  size or type (binary, text etc.) may be, can be converted into
                  a fixed size textual representation. This fixed size
                  representation is called <strong>hash or digest</strong>. This
                  hash or digest are unique to that data. There are no
                  <strong>collisions</strong>. Well almost!. A hash for a given
                  text cannot be converted back to the original text (or binary
                  for that matter). So, hash is not encryption.

                <p>
                  Any time we need a consensus about facts, we use a ledger.
                  Ledgers record the facts underpinning the realities of the
                  civilized world. We generally use ledgers to document
                  ownership (land title), identity (birth registration), status
                  (voter's database) or authority (passport database authorizing
                  someone to travel). All these documents have a central
                  repository called ledger and a token, which you can use as
                  proof of the entry in the ledger.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For instance, the database holding the details of the
                  someone's citizenship is the ledger and the passport, which is
                  the proof, is the token. Such a ledger can be centralized in
                  electronic form or in physical form. Whichever form they take,
                  they are suceptible to unauthorized alteration. In other
                  words, they are mutable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What we need to preserve the integrity of the ledger is to
                  bring immutability to the underlying database.
