          <p>Chicken</p>
          <div id="menu_text">
            It's a classic for good reason, this chicken salad recipe combines
            chicken, mayo, mustard, a dash of hot sauce, and a squeeze of lemon
            juice with minced red onion, celery, and parsley. You can use
            leftover roast chicken, rotisserie chicken, or any chicken you have
            for this delicious lunch. Try it on a bed of mixed greens or a slice
            of whole-grain of bread.

          <div id="menu_text">
            Beef Wellington is a beef tenderloin coated with mushrooms, onions,
            and liver. Puff pastry encases the beef Wellington, making the
            outside buttery and crispy. When shopping for this beef Wellington
            recipe, look for duck liver, chicken liver, or peppercorn mousse in
            specialty-food shops. Try it on a bed of greens or a slice of
            whole-grain of bread.

          <p>Sushi</p>
          <div id="menu_text">
            Serve this sushi cake as a precursor to a light Asian-style meal, or
            alone with hot or cold sake. Since no raw fish is used -- only
            cooked shrimp and lump crabmeat -- the cake can be made ahead of
            time and chilled until ready to serve. There's no raw fish in these
            easy sushi rollsâ€”just succulent, perfectly cooked salmon and plenty
            of fresh vegetables.
