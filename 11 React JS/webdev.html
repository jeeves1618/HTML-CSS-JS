                  Your client doesn't know what he wants. They know their
                  business, but they do not know how to express their business
                  through a website or mbile. Encourage your client not to cram
                  information on the site. Find a way for the client to INVEST
                  in the project. Have a single person responsible for
                  decisions. Limit the number of revisions (or free revisions,
                  if it is a paying job) upfront.

                <p>
                  Involve others when and if they are needed. You may not know
                  all the technologies in the world. By involving others, you
                  learn from them as well. Get an idea of what the client has
                  right now. Talk to the existing users and understand how
                  useful it is. Take help from the internet. Explore the
                  examples of relevant sites to help the client figure out what
                  they really want.

                <p>
                  Yes... thats right. Understand the operations at a very
                  granular level. Find out what the client wants to improve in
                  their operations. Show them the different websites and ask
                  what they like most in those websites. It could be color,
                  fonts or anything. Ask the client who the single point of
                  contact is. Get the commitment that the client will provide
                  all required information.

                  Don't start coding. Do your wireframes through websites like
                  https://balsamiq.com/. Once the wireframes are ready, get the
                  colors added either through phtoshop or powerpoint. Get the
                  combinations from https://coolors.co/palettes, if colors are
                  not your forte. These wireframes and color combinations don't
                  have to be accurate. But, it should pivot you in the right
                  direction.

                <p>
                  To be precise, learn the underlying tech first. They are the
                  constants in the endless fluxes of frameworks thrown at us.
                  The basic building blocks of web development twenty years back
                  were
                  <a
                    href="https://jeeves1618.github.io/HTML-CSS-JS/01%20Basic%20HTML/"
                    target="_blank"
                    >HTML, CSS</a
                  >
                  and
                  <a
                    href="https://jeeves1618.github.io/HTML-CSS-JS/09%20JS/"
                    target="_blank"
                    >JavaScript</a
                  >. And they are still the foundation over which bootstraps,
                  ReachJS etc. are built. So, gain expertise in these three
                  before flaunting your skills in the frameworks.

                  You need a code editor. My choice is Visual Studio Code. You
                  can use Atoms, notepadd or whatever editor you like. Please
                  ensure you are connected to the internet since we will CDN the
                  content necessary for Bootstrap. Have a github account. It
                  will help you to host the site in github pages. Chrome,
                  because of its sophisticated developer tools, is my browser
                  option.
