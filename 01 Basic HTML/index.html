    <h2>HTML Notes</h2>
    <p>HTML is always redendered from top to bottom.</p>
    <p>
      Prior to HTML5, all content models are either block level elements or
      inline elements. The content models in HTML 5 are documented here.
      https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/content-models.html
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML is only for structuring a page. CSS can be used to style h1 as h2. So
      why should we use them? Wny can't we simply use &lt;div&gt; or &lt;p&gt;
      element then? Because, using disticnt semantic elements enhances the
      readability and provides a structure to the html document. It is for the
      meaningful expression of the structure of a page.
    </p>
    <p>HTML entities help avoid rendering issues.</p>
    <p>
      We have three types of selectors, element selectors, class selectors and
      id selectors.
    </p>
    <h2>Basics of CSS</h2>
    <p>
      CSS declaration block contains one or more declarations. A declaration is always formatted
      as a property followed by a colon and then a value followed by a semicolon.
      The colon and semicolon can be followed by zero or more spaces. In nearly all cases,
      a value is either a single keyword or a space-separated list of one or more keywords
      that are permitted for that property. If you use an incorrect property or value in a
      declaration, the whole rule will be ignored.
    </p>
    <h2>Selectors in CSS</h2>
    <p><strong>Selectors can be grouped.</strong>h2, p {color: gray;} By placing the h2 and p selectors on the left side of the rule and separating them with
      a comma, you’ve defined a rule where the style on the right (color: gray;) applies to
      the elements referenced by both selectors. The comma tells the browser that there are
      two different selectors involved in the rule. Leaving out the comma would give the
      rule a completely different meaning, which we’ll explore in “Descendant Selectors”</p>
    
    
    <p>
      If you want the attributes to be applied to multiple selectors at a time,
      then you have to specify the selectors with comma in between. For example,
      p,h1,.classname {...}
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Element with Class Selector</strong> you want the attributes to be
      applied to a select combination of two selectors at a time, then you have
      to specify the selectors with dot in between. For example p.classname
      {...} will be applicable to &lt;p class="classname"&gt; but not to &lt;div
      class="classname"&gt;. The same logic can be used on a combination of two
      class names as well. For instance, .classname1.classname2 {color:blue;}
      will color the element with both classes,
      <strong> &lt;div class="classname1 classname2"&gt; </strong>, as
      <span style="color: blue"> blue </span>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Child Selector</strong> If you want the attributes to be applied
      to a selector (lets say p) only when it is under the block (or a direct
      child) article, then you have to specify them as
      <strong> article &gt; p {...} </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Descendant Selector</strong> What if you want to go beyond direct
      child into grand kids? If you want the attributes to be applied to p
      element under all descendants within article, then you have to specify
      them as
      <strong> article p {...} </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Multiple Classes</strong> If you want to specify two classes for a
      HTML element, you can just list them under class attribute separated by
      spaces<strong> &lt;div class="classone classtwo"&gt; </strong>
      
   
    <p>
      <strong
        >The child and descendant selectors are not limited to HTML elements.
      </strong>
      They can be implemented on classes as well. For instance<strong>
        .colorBlue p { color: blue;}
      </strong>
      CSS tag will have every p inside (at any level) the element with
      class="colorBlue" colored blue. Similarly,
      <strong>div > .colorBlue{ color: blue;}</strong>
      will have the elements with class="colorBlue" which are direct children of
      div element colored in blue.
    </p>

    <p>
      Things we aren't covering here are Adjacent Sibling Selector (Selector +
      Selector) and General Sibling Selector (Selector ~ Selector).
    </p>
    <h2>CSS Psuedo Class Selectors</h2>
    <p>
      A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a
      special state of the selected element(s). For example, :hover can be used
      to change a button's color when the user's pointer hovers over it. The
      syntax of pseudo-classes: <section class="w3-code notranslate cssHigh"></section>selector:pseudo-class { property: value; }</section>
      You can also have multiple pseudo classes like <section class="w3-code notranslate cssHigh"></section>selector:pseudo-class1:pseudo-class2 { property: value; }</section>
      For example, <code>
        div:nth-child(3):hover{
          background-color: green;
          cursor: pointer;
        }
      </code> is valid. 
    </p>
  
  <p>
    Here we are going to cover the following pseudo-class selectors.
    <ul>
      <li>:link</li>
      <li>:visited</li>
      <li>:hover</li>
      <li>:active</li>
      <li>:nth-child</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h2>CSS Style Placement</h2>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>In line styling. You can put the style element inside the tag of the HTML element. For example <code>&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;</code> is valid.</li>
        <li>Styling in head. You can put the same style element inside the head of the HTML document using style tag. For example <code>&lt;head&gt;<br>&lt;p &lt;style&gt;text-align: center;&lt;/style&gt;<br>&lt;/head&gt;</code> is valid.</li>
        <li>External Style sheet. <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="filename.css"&gt;</li></code>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <h2>CSS Rules Conflict Resolution</h2>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Origin Precedence (when there is conflict).</b> HTML is processed sequentially from top to bottom. So, the CSS rules will also be applied sequentially in the same way and the last declaration always gets reflected. 
        For the same of precedence, think of external CSS as expanded at the point where it was declared inside the head.</li>
        <li><b>Origin Precedence (when there is no conflict).</b> When there is no conflict on the properties, i.e. different properties are assigned values at multiple levels, they merge
        together</li>
        <li><b>Levels of specificity</b> First is inline styling within HTML tag with a style = " ". Next comes ID, then comes class, psuedo class and attribute. Finally the number of HTML elements.
        Specificity score is calculated from First to last. It will 1 0 0 0 for a style element with inline styling and 0 1 1 0 for an element with ID and class. Since 1000 > 110, the first will
        have precedence over the second. </li>
        <li><b>Skipping specificity</b> If you want to override all rules, use !importat after the value of the attribute. <code>p { color:green !important; }</code></li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <h2>Text Styling</h2>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Font Family.</b> Specifies the font collections.</li>
        <li><b>Color</b> Text color</li>
        <li><b>Font Style</b> Font styles is where you are going specify italic etc.</li>
        <li><b>Font Size</b> Specify the size of font in pixels. We can state the size in %, for example <code>font-size: 120%</code>. We can also say <code>font-size: 2em</code> which
        will make the text twice as larger. em will have a cumulative effect. It will not override. For instance, if you specify the text as 2em in the body and 4em in the div, the 
      text in div will become 8em. </li>
        <li><b>Font Transform</b> Transforms the text to upper case etc.</li>
        <li><b>Text Align</b> Used to align the text to right, left or center</li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <h2>Box Model</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="/css-box-model.png">
      <p>&copy; <a href="https://sabe.io/classes/css/css-box-model-padding-border-margin">sabe.io</a></p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Margin. </b> Every browser will have a default margin. If you want to reset the marging, you can add style element to body as below. <br>
        <code id="code1">
          body {
            margin: 0; 
            padding: 0;
          }
        </code><br>This proper will stop applying to child elements once you override margin in any one of the child elements. We will have to use the * element 
        to enforce the inheritance then.</li>
        <li><b>Creating a box with margin, border and padding. </b> <br> <code>#box { padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px; border: 20px solid black; margin: 40px; width 300px; height:auto } </code>
          The width here does not include the width of padding, margin and border. If you want the width to be inclusive of all three, use <code>box-sizing: border-box;</code> property. 
        </code><br>Now, if you define a height for this box and this defined height happened to be not big enough to hold the text inside, then the text will overflow. 
      If you want the text to be shown within the box and enable a scroll bar, use the property <code>{overflow: auto;}</code></li>
        <li><b>Inheritance of properties.</b> Some CSS properties are inherited from parent element (e.g body) to child element (e.g div). <code>box-sizing: border-box;</code> is not
        one of those properties. If you want such properties to be applied to all elements under body, then you have to code like this <code>* {box-sizing: border-box;}</code> using universal selector</li>
        <li><b>Cumulative and Collapsing Margins.</b> If there are two elements side by side and the left element has the right margin of 30 and the right element has the left margin of 20,
        then the margin between them will be 50 (cumulative). But, if there are two elements one above the other
         and the top element has the bottom margin of 30 and the bottom element has the top margin of 20,
        then the margin between them will be 30 (Collapsing).</li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <h2>The Background Property</h2>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Creating background for a div. </b> <br> <code>#bg {<br>width 300px; <br>height:500px; background-color: blue; <br>background-image: url("a.jpg");<br>background-repeat: no-repeat;
          <br>background-position: top right; <br>} </code>
          <br>You can also combine all 'background-' properties into one background property as <code>#bg {<br>width 300px; <br>height:500px; background: blue url("a.jpg") no-repeat top right; <br>} </code>.
        </code><br>Now, if you define a height for this box and this defined height happened to be not big enough to hold the text inside, then the text will overflow. 
      If you want the text to be shown within the box and enable a scroll bar, use the property <code>{overflow: auto;}</code></li>
        <li><b>background will override</b> all previously defined background- properties. If a background- property is not explicitly defined in background, then the browser default will 
        override what was specified in background- </li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <h2>Floating, Relative and Absolute</h2>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Creating background for a div. </b> <br> <code>#bg {<br>width 300px; <br>height:500px; background-color: blue; <br>background-image: url("a.jpg");<br>background-repeat: no-repeat;
            <br>background-position: top right; <br>} </code>
            <br>You can also combine all 'background-' properties into one background property as <code>#bg {<br>width 300px; <br>height:500px; background: blue url("a.jpg") no-repeat top right; <br>} </code>.
          </code><br>Now, if you define a height for this box and this defined height happened to be not big enough to hold the text inside, then the text will overflow. 
        If you want the text to be shown within the box and enable a scroll bar, use the property <code>{overflow: auto;}</code></li>
          <li><b>background will override</b> all previously defined background- properties. If a background- property is not explicitly defined in background, then the browser default will 
          override what was specified in background- </li>
