    <h1>Basic HTML Document Structure</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>HTML is always redendered from top to bottom.</p>
    <p>
      Prior to HTML5, all content models are either block level elements or
      inline elements. The content models in HTML 5 are documented here.
      https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/content-models.html

      HTML is only for structuring a page. CSS can be used to style h1 as h2. So
      why should we use them? Wny can't we simply use &lt;div&gt; or &lt;p&gt;
      element then? Because, using disticnt semantic elements enhances the
      readability and provides a structure to the html document. It is for the
      meaningful expression of the structure of a page.

    <p>HTML entities help avoid rendering issues.</p>
