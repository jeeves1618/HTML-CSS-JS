                <h2 class="content">What is Asynchronous JS?</h2>
                <p>
                  Imagine having an alert statement in your program.
                  <span class="js-text">alert("click on ok to proceed")</span
                  >.This statement will block rest of the lines in your program
                  from executing. Because, by default, JavaScript is going to
                  execute the lines in synchronous fashion. And, synchronous
                  code is blocking in nature.
                </p>
                <p>Now, imagine a piece of code like this.</p>
                <p>
                  <span class="js-text"
                    >const a = "Synchronous processing is done!";<br />
                    setTimeout(function () {<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;console.log("Asynchronous process is also
                    done!");<br />
                    }, 2000);<br />
                    console.log(a);</span
                  >
                </p>
                <p>
                  Here, the line after setTimeout function will not wait for the
                  setTimeout to complete. This is Asynchronous processing and it
                  is non blocking in nature.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The anonymous function passed as one of the two parameters to
                  setTimeout is the <strong>callback function</strong>.
                  Callback, as such, doesn't make the code asynchronous. Even in
                  maps, we will use call back.

                <p>
                  <strong>A</strong>synchronous <strong>J</strong>avascript
                  <strong>A</strong>nd <strong>X</strong>ML is used to
                  communicate with other web services in an asynchronous way.
                  Though we have XML in the name of AJAX, no one uses XML these
                  days. So, we will be doing AJAX calls with JSON.
                </p>
                <ol class="js-text">
                  <li>const req = new XMLHttpRequest();</li>
                  <li>
                    req.open("GET", "https://restcountries.com<br />/v3.1/name/spain");
                  </li>
                  <li>req.send();</li>
                  <li>req.addEventListener("load", function () {</li>
                  <li>const [data] = JSON.parse(req.responseText);</li>
                  <li>console.log(data);</li>
                  <li>});</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  We are doing few interesting things here. We are using
                  XMLHttpRequest which is a built-in object in web browsers. It
                  cannot be used in NodeJS. We are sending the request using
                  <span class="js-text">req.send();</span>. If we log
                  <span class="js-text">req.responseText</span> right after that
                  it will be null. Because, send is an asynchronous call. We
                  received the response as JSON in an array of one element. We
                  convert that JSON into JavaScript object using parse function.
                  Then we use Array destructuring to collect the object into a
                  variable called data. We have created an anonymous callback
                  function once the response is loaded and we listen to the
                  response through addEventListener.
                </p>

                <h2 class="content">Problem with callback</h2>
                <p>
                  Let's we wrap the above code into a function,
                  <span class="js-text">function getCounty (countryName)</span
                  >,and invoke that in the following order.
                </p>
                <ol class="js-text">
                  <li>getCounty("usa");</li>
                  <li>getCounty("spain");</li>
                  <li>getCounty("mexico");</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  There is no guarantee that you will get the response in the
                  same order. This is a problem when you invoke services which
                  needs to be invoked in a consistent order.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One way of mitigating that is to have nested callbacks. That
                  is, you write the second service call inside the callback
                  function of the first call, so on and so forth. This can get
                  very complicated when you have to make multiple service calls.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That is where Fetch and Promises from ES6 comes to our rescue.
                  Instead of using
                  <span class="js-text">XMLHttpRequest();</span>, if we use the
                  fetch to get the response from the same URL, it will return a
                  promise. A promise is nothing but a container for a future
                  value. That is, JavaScript is promising that you will receive
                  a value at an unknown time into the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                  MDN docs defines the promise as an object representing the
                  eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
                </p>
              </div>
            </article>
          </li>
          <li class="topic-item">
            <article>
              <div class="topic-item-content">
                <h2 class="content">Promises</h2>
                <ol class="js-text">
                  <li>
                    const req =
                    fetch("https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/usa");
                  </li>
                  <li>console.log(req);</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  Above fetch will kick start an async process and will return a
                  promise in the pending status. Once, the async process is
                  completed, the promise will go to the settled status. A
                  settled promise can be either fulfilled or rejected.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Promises are not going to eliminate callbacks. They will just
                  prevent nested callbacks by chaining the promises more
                  sequentially. Promises have the inbuilt 'then' method. We will
                  define the callback functions within the then method.
                </p>
                <ol class="js-text">
                  <li>const getCountryData = function (country) {</li>
                  <li>
                    fetch(`https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${country}`)
                  </li>
                  <li>.then(function (ajaxResponse) {</li>
                  <li>return ajaxResponse.json();</li>
                  <li>})</li>
                  <li>.then(function (formatedData) {</li>
                  <li>console.log(formatedData);</li>
                  <li>});</li>
                  <li>};</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  ajaxResponse is a read stream and should be converted to JSON
                  using .json method. But, the .json method itself is a async
                  method returning a promise. That is why we have the second
                  'then' to capture the formatted data.
