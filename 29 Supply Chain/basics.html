                <p>
                  A supply chain consists of all parties involved in directly or
                  indirectly fulfilling a customer request. The supply chain
                  includes not only the manufacturer and suppliers, but also
                  transporters, warehouses, retailers, distributors and the
                  customers themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We can think of supply chain as a dynamic network of entities
                  that facilitates the constant flow of information, product,
                  and funds between different stages.

                <h2 class="content">Objective</h2>
                <p>
                  The objective of every supply chain should be to maximize the
                  overall value generated. The value, a supply chain generates, is
                  the difference between the value of final product <em>to the
                  customer</em> and the sum of all costs incurred by the supply
                  chain. This overall value is measured in terms of
                  supply chain profitability</em> or
                  <strong>Supply Chain Surplus</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The higher the supply chain profitability, the more successful
                  is the supply chain.

                <h2 class="content">Supply Chain Surplus</h2>
                <p>
                  Total Cost Incurred by the supply chain + Profit margin =
                  Price of the product.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Value of the final product to the customer - Price of the
                  product = <strong>Consumer Surplus</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Price of the product + Consumer Surplus = Supply Chain Surplus
                </p>
                <p>
                  The success of the supply chain should always measured in
                  terms of supply chain surplus and not in terms of the profits
                  at the individual stage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When we look for sources of value in a supply chain, we should
                  understand that the customer is the only one who can provide
                  positive cash flow in a supply chain.

                <h2 class="content">Decision Phases</h2>
                <p>
                  During the<strong> strategy phase</strong> of supply chain
                  management, we configure the supply chain. This is where an
                  organization may design their distribution centers and stores
                  in a hub and spoke model. In this phase the company commits to a
                  structure of a supply chain for the next several years. Supply
                  chain strategy decisions, once implemented, are expensive to
                  alter.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Next comes the <strong>planning phase</strong> of a supply
                  chain. In this phase, we usually plan for a year or a quarter
                  within the confines of the constraints established in the
                  strategy phase. The decisions during the phase includes
                  logistical coverage, transportation sub contracting etc..
                </p>
                <p>
                  Next comes the <strong>operations phase</strong>. In the
                  operations phase we think about inventory management, Economic
                  Order Quantity (EOQ) calculation etc.. The time horizon here
                  can be daily or weekly.

                <h2 class="content">Cycles</h2>
                <p>
                  The tasks in a supply chain can be divided into a series of
                  interfaces between two parties (supplier and buyer) called
                  cycles. For instance, customer cycle will be an interface
                  between retailer and the customer. Similary, replenishment
                  cycle is the interface between distributor and the retailer.
                  Then comes the manufacturing cycle between distributor and the
                  manufacturer, followed by the procurement cycle between
                  manufacturer and raw material supplier.
                </p>
                <p>Each cycle has six sub processes.</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Supplier stage markets the product</li>
                  <li>Buyer places the order</li>
                  <li>Supplier receives the order</li>
                  <li>Supplier supplies the order</li>
                  <li>Buyer receives the order</li>
                  <li>Buyer returns reverse flows to supplier</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  In these six process buyer is usually the one on the customer
                  side of the cycle and the supplier is the one on the raw
                  material side of the spectrum.

                <h2 class="content">Pull and Push</h2>
                <p>
                  All processes in a supply chain fall into one of the two
                  categories, depending on the timing of their execution
                  relative to end customer demand. With pull processes,
                  execution is initiated in response to a customer order. With
                  push processes, execution is initiated in anticipation of
                  customer orders.
                </p>

                <p>
                  At the time of execution of a pull process, customer demand is
                  known with certainty, whereas at the time of execution of a
                  push process, demand is not known and must be forecast. Pull
                  processes may also be referred to as reactive processes
                  because they react to customer demand. Push processes may also
                  be referred to as speculative processes because they respond
                  to speculated (or forecasted) rather than actual demand. The
                  push/pull boundary in a supply chain separates push processes
                  from pull processes
                </p>
                <p>
                  Push processes operate in an uncertain environment because
                  customer demand is not yet known. Pull processes operate in an
                  environment in which customer demand is known.
