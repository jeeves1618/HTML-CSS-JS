                <p>
                  A <strong>competitive strategy</strong> is a set of policies
                  and procedures that a business uses to gain a competitive
                  advantage in the market. It's the process of identifying and
                  executing actions that allow a business to improve its
                  competitive position.
                </p>

                  <li>
                    <strong>Cost leadership strategy</strong>: In this business
                    strategy, a company utilizes economies of scale to gain a
                    price advantage over its competitors.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Differentiation leadership strategy</strong>: In
                    this competitive strategy, you gain a competitive advantage
                    by having a product that distinguishes itself from the
                    competition.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Cost focus strategy</strong>: This approach utilizes
                    the basic philosophy of the cost leadership strategy but
                    with a specific focus on a particular market segment.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Differentiation focus strategy</strong>: The
                    differentiation focus strategy offers a specialized product
                    to a specific market segment rather than the entire
                    marketplace.

                <p>
                  The term value chain refers to the various business activities
                  and processes involved in creating a product or performing a
                  service. A typical organization has New Product Development,
                  Marketing and Sales, Operations, Distribution and Services as
                  the core processes. Finance, Accounting, IT and HR support and
                  faiciliate the core processes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Supply chain strategies specify what the operations,
                  distribution and service functions should do.

                  To execute a company's competitive strategy, all these
                  functions play a role, and each must develop its own strategy.
                  Here, strategy refers to what each process or function will
                  try to do particularly well.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A product development strategy specifies the portfolio of new
                  products that a company will try to develop. A marketing and
                  sales strategy specifies how the market will be segmented and
                  how the product will be positioned, priced, and promoted.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A <strong>supply chain strategy</strong> determines the nature
                  of procurement of raw materials, transportation of materials
                  to and from the company, manufacture of the product or
                  operation to provide the service, and distribution of the
                  product to the customer, along with any follow-up service and
                  a specification of whether these processes will be performed
                  in-house or outsourced.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It all boils down to handling the uncertainties. There are
                  three types of uncertainties. Supply, Demand and Implied
                  Demand uncertainties.

              <div class="topic-item-content">
                <h2 class="content">Implied Demand Uncertainty</h2>
                <p>
                  Demand uncertainty reflects the uncertainty of customer demand
                  for a product, whereas
                  <strong>Implied Demand Uncertainty</strong> is the resulting
                  uncertainty for only the portion of the demand that the supply
                  chain plans to satisfy. That is, Implied Demand Uncertainty is
                  the demand uncertainty constrained on a supply chain because
                  of the market segment it seeks to satisfy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, a firm supplying only emergency orders for a
                  product will face a higher implied demand uncertainty than a
                  firm that supplies the same product with a long lead time, as
                  the second firm has an opportunity to fulfill the orders
                  evenly over the long lead time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Also, as a supply chain raises its level of service, it must
                  be able to meet a higher and higher percentage of actual
                  demand, forcing it to prepare for rare surges in demand. Thus,
                  raising the service level increases the implied demand
                  uncertainty even though the product's underlying demand
                  uncertainty does not change.

                <p>
                  Strategic fit requires that both the competitive and supply
                  chain strategies of a company are aligned. If this alignment
                  is not achieved, conflicts arise between different functional
                  goals within the firm, or between the goals of different
                  supply chain stages. Consider, for example, a situation in
                  which marketing is publicizing a company's ability to provide
                  a large variety of products very quickly; simultaneously,
                  distribution is targeting the lowest cost means of
                  transportation.
                </p>

                <p>
                  A competitive strategy will specify, either explicitly or
                  implicitly, one or more customer segments that a company hopes
                  to satisfy. To achieve strategic fit, a company must ensure
                  that its supply chain capabilities support its ability to
                  satisfy the targeted customer segments.

                  Supply chain responsiveness includes a supply chain's ability
