                <p>
                  super() is a way to call a constructor on the super class,
                  directly from the sub class's constructor. Like this(), it has
                  to be the first statement of the constructor. Because of this
                  rule,
                  <strong
                    >super() and this() can never be called from the same
                    constructor</strong
                  >.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, it is a challenge if we want to manipulate data passed as
                  parameter before calling super. We can try something like
                  this.
                </p>
                <span class="java-text"
                  >super(isTurboCharged,engineVolumeInCC < 1000 ? "Small" :
                  (engineVolumeInCC > 1500 ? "Large" : "Medium"))</span
                >
                <p>
                  If a subclass doesn't make a call to super(), java will make
                  that call to the default constructor of the super class. If
                  the default constructor of the super class isn't there,
                  because a constructor was explicitly defined, then the
                  subclass must explicitly call that constructor in the super
                  class.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A object of type sub class can be passed to the method
                  accepting the super class. But, the converse is not possible.

                <p>
                  Inheritance defines an
                  <strong>IS A</strong> relationship. Composition defines an
                  <strong>HAS A</strong> relationship.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We started talking about composition in the previous section
                  itself to compare it against inheritance. Inheritance is a way
                  to reuse functionality and attributes. Composition is a way to
                  make the combination of classes, act like a single coherent
                  object.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a general rule, when you are designing programs in Java,
                  you probably want to look at composition first. In the

                  parts, to access the personal computer to do something.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But, all those parts were able to inherit a set of attributes,
                  like the manufacturer and model. We used inheritance to reuse
                  and composition

                <p>
                  In Java, encapsulation means hiding things by marking them as
                  private and inaccessible. Why should we hide things? Look at

                    1. Any change in the variable name in player class will
                    cause the calling methods to change.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    2. The player class doesn't have any control on its
                    variables. Anyone can change the public variables directly.
                  </li>
                  <li>3. No validations are done on the public attributes.</li>

                <p>
                  In Java, you can declare an object of one type and execute it
                  as another type provided the declared type has some sort of
                  relationship with the runtime type. Inheritance is one way to
                  establish such a relationship.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Polymorphism in Java has two types: Runtime polymorphism
                  (dynamic binding) and Compile time polymorphism (static
                  binding). Method overriding is an example of dynamic
                  polymorphism, while method overloading is an example of static
                  polymorphism.
