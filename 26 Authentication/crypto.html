                <p>
                  Encoding is a process to transform data from one format to
                  another so that it can be understood and consumed by different
                  systems. The encoded data can be easily decoded back and it is
                  not a secure way. Here the word '<strong>Encoding</strong>' is
                  represented through English alpahbets. This can also be
                  represented in to sequence of bits like this:
                  <code
                    >01000101 01101110 01100011 01101111 01100100 01101001
                    01101110 01100111</code
                  >
                </p>

                <p>
                  Now, we have two representations for the same information. We
                  can say that the sequence of letters has been encoded into a
                  sequence of bits. So, encoding is just a transformation from
                  one data representation to another, keeping the same
                  information. Usually, it involves a conversion table, such as
                  an ASCII table in our example, that maps a representation item
                  in one system to the corresponding representation item in the
                  other system.

                <p>
                  A binary data can be converted in to textual representation
                  and back to binary using Base64 encoding. One common use of
                  Base64 is the conversion of binary data into text during a
                  HTML post. If the Base64 encoded text is used in the URL, it
                  still has to go through URL encoder. Again, like URL encoding,
                  Base64 encoding is also not encryption. The encoded textual
                  data can be decoded to binaries easily.

                <p>
                  The idea behind hashing is that, any data, no matter what the
                  size or type (binary, text etc.) may be, can be converted into
                  a fixed size textual representation. This fixed size
                  representation is called <strong>hash or digest</strong>. This
                  hash or digest are unique to that data. There are no
                  <strong>collisions</strong>. A hash for a given text cannot be
                  converted back to the original text (or binary for that
                  matter). So, hash is not encryption.

                <p>
                  There are several algorithms for creating hash. The most
                  popular among them are SHA-512, SHA-256, SHA-1 and MD5. The
                  size of the hash dependends on the type of the algorithm used.
                  SHA-256 will create a 256 bit output hash, SHA-512 will create
                  a 512 bit output hash and so on. Let's look at the two
                  important characteristics of hashing.
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    It creates an unique, fixed size output for every unique
                    input. No collisions.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    And you cannot (or it is computationally infeasible to)
                    derive the input from the output hash. It is one way (well
                    almost).
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  Above two characteristics makes it an ideal choice to store
                  the passwords. Here is how it is done.
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    A user visits a site and fills in a form to create their
                    username and password.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    That password is put through a hash function and the hash is
                    stored in the database.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When a user logs in they enter their password again on the
                    site.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    That entered password is run through the same hashing
                    function as was used before.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The server checks this hash against the one stored for the
                    user in the database.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If the two hashes match exactly, the user will be granted
                    access.

                <img src="./img/symmetric.jpg" />
                <p>
                  There are several algorithms for encrypting a message with a
                  secret key. The most popular among them are AES-128, AES-256,
                  BlowFish and DES. The size of the secret key dependends on the
                  type of the algorithm used. AES-128 will need a 128 bit or 16
                  byte secret key, AES-256 will need a 256 bit or 32 byte secret
                  key.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Symmetric key encryption works exceptionally well for
                  encrypted data transfers between predefined destinations. It
                  is simple and efficient for large data sets. So, the SSH
                  protocol uses Symmetric key encryption to exchange data
                  between two trusted computers over an untrusted network.
                </p>

                <p>
                  But, if you are transferring data to newer computers on a
                  regular basis, you won't have the option to share the secret
                  key upfront. And, you cannot send it along with your data.
                  That defeats the purpose of having a key. So, the symmetric
                  encryption fails when the key needs to be distributed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, we came up with the asymmetric encryption where there are
                  two keys; private and public. If you encrypt the data using
                  public key, then the decryption can be done only using
                  corresponding private key. If you sign the data using the
                  private key, then the verification can only be done using the
                  corresponding public key.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When Alice sends a message to Bob, she encrypts it using Bob's
                  public key. Bob uses the corresponding private key, which is
                  available only with him, to decrypt the message.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One major issue with asymmetric encryption is that the data
                  cannot be large. In fact, it is expected to be only as big as
                  the key used to encrypt. Encrypting large data sets using RSA
                  keys will be highly inefficient.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The problems of authentication and large network privacy
                  protection were addressed theoretically in 1976 by Whitfield
                  Diffie and Martin Hellman. The idea came to fruition in 1977
                  with the invention of the RSA Public Key Cryptosystem by
                  Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len Adleman, then professors at
                  the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Inversely, the user can also scramble data using their private
                  key; in other words, RSA keys work in either direction. This
                  provides the basis for the "digital signature," for if the
                  user can unscramble a message with someone's public key, the
                  other user must have used their private key to scramble it in
                  the first place. Since only the owner can utilize their own
                  private key, the scrambled message becomes a kind of
                  electronic signature—a document that nobody else can produce.

                <p>
                  In the previous section, alice and bob exchanged their public
                  keys. But, how do they know someone else is not impersonating
                  as Bob or Alice and are sending their public keys. That is
                  where certificate comes into picture.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whenever an entity wants to create an RSA key pair, the public
                  key is sent to a certificate authority along with the details
                  (corporate details, TIN etc.) required to verify the identity
                  of the public key holder.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The solution is the <strong>digital certificate</strong>, a
                  kind of digital "passport" or "credential." The digital
                  certificate is the user's public key that has itself been
                  "digitally signed" by someone trusted to do so, such as a
                  network security director, MIS help desk, or VeriSign, Inc.
                  The following figure presents a pictorial description of a
                  digital certificate. Every time someone sends a message, they
                  attach their digital certificate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The recipient of the message first uses the digital
                  certificate to verify that the author's public key is
                  authentic, then uses that public key to verify the message
                  itself. This way, only one public key, that of the certifying
                  authority, has to be centrally stored or widely publicized,
                  since then everyone else can simply transmit their public key
                  and valid digital certificate with their messages.
