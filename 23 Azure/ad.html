                  Microsoft has built lot of data centers for Azure. These data
                  centers are called regions. The available Azure regions are
                  documented
                  <a
                    href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/geographies/#overview"

                    >here</a
                  >. You can pick the region closest to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some regions can have more than one physical data center
                  enabling greater availability for the users. When a region has
                  more than one data center, it is said to have availability
                  zones.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Azure has also set up complete fall backs for some regions.
                  That is, when one full region fails, the other one can fill
                  its place. These paired regions are set up by Microsoft and
                  cannot be changed by us.

                <p>
                  Creation of account requires credit card. It will not be
                  charged. Once we have the account created, we will have access
                  to https://portal.azure.com/. Azure portal is the main
                  dasboard from which we can access all its services and
                  resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A resource group is a container that holds related resources
                  for an Azure solution. The resource group can include all the
                  resources for the solution, or only those resources that you
                  want to manage as a group. Search for resource groups and
                  create a new one attached to the subscription of our choice.
                  We should also select the closest location. The tags are
                  optional. We can search for this resource using its name.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We can also use the CLI option in the portal. Using Azure
                  Cloud Shell will require Azure file share to persist. The
                  Azure file share will be created under a new resource group
                  within the selected subscription.

                <p>
                  Azure has two interfaces for CLI commands, Azure Bash and
                  PowerShell. All Bash CLI comments start with az.
                  <code class="cli-text"
                    >az group create --location southindia -n cliTest-rg</code
                  >
                  will create a new resource group called cliTest-rg in the
                  location southindia.
                </p>
                <p>
                  PowerShell accomplishes the same through a different syntax.
                  <code class="cli-text"
                    >New-AzResourceGroup -Name PSTest-rg -Location
                    southindia</code
                  >
                  will create a new resource group called PSTest-rg in the
                  location southindia.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Azure Bash can be integrated into other applications like
                  Python while PowerShell will not lend itself to such
                  integrations.

                <h2 class="content">Resource Groups</h2>
                <p>
                  Resource groups are nothing but
                  <strong> a logical container </strong> for resources. Resource
                  groups are completely free. We can create as many as we want.
                  Usually, we create separate resource groups for Development,
                  Test and Production. We will also have separate resource
                  groups for applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A subscription is also a logical container. So, what is the
                  difference between a subscription and a resource group? Azure
                  provides four levels of management: management groups,
                  subscriptions, resource groups, and resources.

                  has the diagram that shows the relationship between these
                  levels. Resource Groups are usually prefixed or suffixed by RG
                  or rg.

                <p>
                  Storage accounts are special type of accounts used to store
                  anything in Azure. They are used to store implicit data like
                  VM disks, database backups and other diagnostic data.

                <p>
                  It can also be used for storing application data. Storage
                  account is very cheap and can be used to store GBs of data.

                <p>
                  The major factor behind the selection of region is the
                  <strong> proximity</strong> to the application users. Another
                  factor is the

                  and products in the regions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you have strict redundancy requirements, you may also want
                  to choose a region with <strong>availability zones</strong>.
                  Another important factor is pricing.
                  <strong>Pricing</strong> is not same across all regions.

                <p>
                  Almost everything in cloud costs money. There are few pricing
                  models we need to be aware. One is pricing
                  <strong>per resource</strong>. For instance, we can have a VM
                  and pay for that VM irrespective of usage. We can also pay
                  <strong>per consumption</strong>. Another way of paying is
                  <strong>reserving</strong> a resource for a specified duration
                  and paying upfront.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Always check the resource's cost before provisioning. You can
                  look for const effective alternatives like reservations first.
                  We can check the cost of services using
                  <a
                    href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/calculator/"

                  >
                </p>
                <p>
                  We can also set up the billing scope to ensure that we are
                  within budget. Search for "Cost Management + Billing" in the
                  portal. Under cost management, we should select budgets and
                  create a new budget, threshold and notification.
