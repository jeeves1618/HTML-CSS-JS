                <p>
                  Compute is a set of cloud services for hosting and running our
                  applications. It is with the compute services that we upload
                  our code and run it. It offers various levels and controls and
                  flexibility.
                </p>
                <p>There are four types of compute services.</p>
                <ol>

                  A virtual (=not real) server is a program running a physical
                  (=real) server. It allows creation of new servers extremely
                  fast because we are not provisioning any new hardware
                  resources. It is created on the existing resources of the
                  physical server. From the user's perspective, it is regular
                  server that you can connect through SSH etc..
                </p>
                <p>
                  An Azure virtual machine is an unmanaged service. That is
                  because Azure doesn't manage what is happening inside the
                  virtual machine. Azure doesn't care about the kind of OS,
                  presence of anti virus etc. They are our responsibilities and
                  that makes VMs a classic Infrastructure as a Service.

                  The pysical layer is managed by Azure with no control or

                  with complete control and access. Please note that here Azure
                  provides just the Infrastructure and this set up is a classic

                <p>
                  We can create a VM in Azure by selecting the location, image
                  (OS and other pre installed softwares) and the compute size.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Before creating a VM, we can check the pricing
                  <a
                    href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/calculator/"
                    target="_blank"
                    >here</a
                  >. Once we have selected the region, OS and instance, search
                  for Virtual Machine in the portal. Click on the add button to
                  fill up the form for provisioning the VM. If we select a
                  Windows VM, we will be asked to create an administrator
                  account within the VM.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once you submit the form, Azure will start a deployment task
                  to create the VM. And you will see four more VMs will be
                  created. These addional resources are created for network
                  interfaces, security groups, IP addresses and virtual
                  networks. Once the VM is created, you can connect to that VM
                  through SSH, RDP or Bastion. Usually we use RDP for Windows
                  and SSH for Linux.
                </p>

              <div class="topic-item-content">
                <h2 class="content">Connecting to VMs</h2>
                <p>
                  If we create a VM with Windows VM, we can connect using RDP.
                  We will have to download the RDP file. Executing the RDP file
                  will give the option to connect. Clicking on connect will ask
                  for credentials. Provide the user name as
                  ./AzureAccountUserName. This will connect you to a Windows
                  machine where you can install software, browse website etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We can close the virtual machine if we are not working on it.
                  But, closing it will not stop the server. We can stop the
                  server through the portal. But, stopping the server will not
                  stop the payments completely because of implicit usage of
                  resources. So, if you want to save money, please go ahead and
                  delete the resource group completely.
                </p>

                  The real cost of the VM includes the cost of VM, the cost of

                    >disk</a
                  >, the cost of the IP through which the VM is exposed and the
                  cost of the storage where the image of the VM is stored. Here
                  is the cost distribution for a small VM.

                <h2 class="content">Reducing Cost</h2>
                <p>
                  If you want to reduce the cost during the development phase
                  without deleting and recreating the resource group, you can
                  opt for <strong>Auto Shutdown</strong> to automatically shut
                  down the machine when not needed. The storage and the IP costs
                  will still be incurred. Still you can save more than 50% of VM
                  cost.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Upfront payment using <strong>Reserved Instances</strong> (for
                  1 or 3 years) will help reducing the cost. Another way of
                  reducing cost is to use <strong>Spot Instances</strong>. We
                  can utilize the unused capacity in Azure with the risk of
                  getting evicted any moment. For non critical and non
                  continuous dev applications, spot instances can provide upto
                  90% discount. Your discount will be based on the eviction type
                  and policy choices.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fourth way of reducing cost is
                  <strong>Disk Optimization.</strong> For many VMs, the default
                  disk is Premium SSD, which is the most expensive option. If
                  our app is not very data intensive, we can go for standard
                  SSD.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Always select the right VMs. The CPU shouldn't be under
                  utilized. Also, we should select Linux over Windows whenever
                  possible. For non prod applications, check the price in
                  cheaper regions since latency is not a challenge.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Focussing on cost will have a trade off on the availability of
                  VMs. We will discuss availability in the next section.

                    >The SLA</a
                  >
                  for virtual machines is dependent on the number of instances
                  and the choice of the disk. As you can see in the link, there
                  are five SLAs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Almost everything in cloud costs money. There are few pricing
                  models we need to be aware. One is pricing
                  <strong>per resource</strong>. For instance, we can have a VM
                  and pay for that VM irrespective of usage. We can also pay
                  <strong>per consumption</strong>. Another way of paying is
                  <strong>reserving</strong> a resource for a specified duration
                  and paying upfront.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Always check the resource's cost before provisioning. You can
                  look for const effective alternatives like reservations first.
                  We can check the cost of services using
                  <a
                    href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/calculator/"
                    target="_blank"
                    >the pricing calculator.</a
                  >
                </p>
                <p>
                  We can also set up the billing scope to ensure that we are
                  within budget. Search for "Cost Management + Billing" in the
                  portal. Under cost management, we should select budgets and
                  create a new budget, threshold and notification.
