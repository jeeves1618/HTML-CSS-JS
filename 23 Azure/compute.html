                  Compute is a set of cloud services for hosting and running our
                  applications. It is with the compute services that we upload
                  our code and run it. It offers various levels and controls and
                  flexibility.
                </p>
                <p>There are four types of compute services.</p>

                  A virtual (=not real) server is a program running a physical
                  (=real) server. It allows creation of new servers extremely
                  fast because we are not provisioning any new hardware
                  resources. It is created on the existing resources of the
                  physical server. From the user's perspective, it is regular
                  server that you can connect through SSH etc..
                </p>
                <p>
                  An Azure virtual machine is an unmanaged service. That is
                  because Azure doesn't manage what is happening inside the
                  virtual machine. Azure doesn't care about the kind of OS,
                  presence of anti virus etc. They are our responsibilities and
                  that makes VMs a classic Infrastructure as a Service.

                <p>
                  We can create a VM in Azure by selecting the location, image
                  (OS and other pre installed softwares) and the compute size.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Before creating a VM, we can check the pricing
                  <a
                    href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/calculator/"
                    target="_blank"
                    >here</a
                  >. Once we have selected the region, OS and instance, search
                  for Virtual Machine in the portal. Click on the add button to
                  fill up the form for provisioning the VM. If we select a
                  Windows VM, we will be asked to create an administrator
                  account within the VM.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once you submit the form, Azure will start a deployment task
                  to create the VM. And you will see four more VMs will be
                  created. These addional resources are created for network
                  interfaces, security groups, IP addresses and virtual
                  networks. Once the VM is created, you can connect to that VM
                  through SSH, RDP or Bastion. Usually we use RDP for Windows
                  and SSH for Linux.
                </p>

                <h2 class="content">Connecting to VMs</h2>
                <p>
                  If we create a VM with Windows VM, we can connect using RDP.
                  We will have to download the RDP file. Executing the RDP file
                  will give the option to connect. Clicking on connect will ask
                  for credentials. Provide the user name as
                  ./AzureAccountUserName. This will connect you to a Windows
                  machine where you can install software, browse website etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We can close the virtual machine if we are not working on it.
                  But, closing it will not stop the server. We can stop the
                  server through the portal. But, stopping the server will not
                  stop the payments completely because of implicit usage of
                  resources. So, if you want to save money, please go ahead and
                  delete the resource group completely.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The real cost of the VM includes the cost of VM, the cost of

                    >disk</a
                  >, the cost of the IP through which the VM is exposed and the
                  cost of the storage where the image of the VM is stored. Here
                  is the cost distribution for a small VM.

                <h2 class="content">Reducing Cost</h2>
                <p>
                  If you want to reduce the cost during the development phase
                  without deleting and recreating the resource group, you can
                  opt for <strong>Auto Shutdown</strong> to automatically shut
                  down the machine when not needed. The storage and the IP costs
                  will still be incurred. Still you can save more than 50% of VM
                  cost.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Upfront payment using <strong>Reserved Instances</strong> (for
                  1 or 3 years) will help reducing the cost. Another way of
                  reducing cost is to use <strong>Spot Instances</strong>. We
                  can utilize the unused capacity in Azure with the risk of
                  getting evicted any moment. For non critical and non
                  continuous dev applications, spot instances can provide upto
                  90% discount. Your discount will be based on the eviction type
                  and policy choices.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fourth way of reducing cost is
                  <strong>Disk Optimization.</strong> For many VMs, the default
                  disk is Premium SSD, which is the most expensive option. If
                  our app is not very data intensive, we can go for standard
                  SSD.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Always select the right VMs. The CPU shouldn't be under
                  utilized. Also, we should select Linux over Windows whenever
                  possible. For non prod applications, check the price in
                  cheaper regions since latency is not a challenge.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Focussing on cost will have a trade off on the availability of
                  VMs. We will discuss availability in the next section.

                    >The SLA</a
                  >
                  for virtual machines is dependent on the number of instances
                  and the choice of the disk. As you can see in the link, there
                  are five SLAs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We have to understand four important availability concepts in
                  Azure in order build high availability applications. They are
                  fault domain, update domain, availability set and availability
                  zone. Leveraging these concepts will help in increasing
                  availability without addional cost.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A fault domain is the group of physical hardware that share a
                  common power source, network switch etc. and can go down as
                  whole if there are power or network interruptions. An update
                  domain is the Logical group of physical hardware that can
                  undergo maintenance and be rebooted at the same time.
                  Maintenance is done by Azure at its own discretion.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, if all our VMs are in the same fault domain, they can go
                  down at the same time. If all our VMs are in the same update
                  domain they will reboot at the same time during maintenance.
                  The trick is to keep them spread across fault and update
                  domains. That is where the availability set comes into
                  picture.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An availability set is the arrangement of our VMs across fault
                  domains and update domains for maximum availability. One
                  availability set can contain up to 3 Fault Domains and up to
                  20 Update Domains. All domains are in the same datacenter (i.e
                  same building).
                </p>

                  Availability zone is a separate building, containing an
                  autonomous data center, within an availability region. The
                  different zones within a region functions as fault and update
                  domains. It is configured in a way that even when one
                  autonomous datacenter is down, we can ensure availability
                  through other. This arrangement has the highest SLA. > The
